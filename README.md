# Bonny: Kubernetes Development Framework

Extend the Kubernetes API with Elixir.

Bonny make it easy to create Kubernetes Operators, Controllers, and Custom [Schedulers](./lib/bonny/server/scheduler.ex).

If Kubernetes CRDs and controllers are new to you, read up on the [terminology](#terminology).

## Tutorials and Examples:

_Important!_ These tutorials are for an older version of Bonny, but the `add/1`, `modify/1`, and `delete/1` APIs are the same, as well as a new `reconcile/1` function. Additionally a [k8s](https://github.com/coryodaniel/k8s) has been added!

Feel free to message me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/coryodaniel) if you need any help!

## Example Operators built with Bonny

- [Eviction Operator](https://github.com/bonny-k8s/eviction_operator) - Bonny v 0.4
- [Hello Operator](https://github.com/coryodaniel/hello_operator) - Bonny v 0.4
- [Todo Operator](https://github.com/bonny-k8s/todo-operator) - Bonny v 0.4
## Installation

Bonny can be installed by adding `bonny` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bonny, "~> 0.4"}
  ]
end
```

### Configuration

Bonny uses the [k8s client](https://github.com/coryodaniel/k8s) under the hood.

The only configuration parameters required are `:bonny` `controllers` and a `:k8s` cluster:

```elixir

config :k8s,
  clusters: %{
    default: %{ # `default` here must match `cluster_name` below
      conn: "~/.kube/config"
    }
  }

config :bonny,
  # Add each CRD Controller module for this operator to load here
  # Defaults to none. This *must* be set.
  controllers: [
    MyApp.Controllers.V1.WebServer,
    MyApp.Controllers.V1.Database,
    MyApp.Controllers.V1.Memcached
  ],

  # K8s.Cluster to use, defaults to :default
  cluster_name: :default,

  # The namespace to watch for Namespaced CRDs.
  # Defaults to "default". `:all` for all namespaces
  # Also configurable via environment variable `BONNY_POD_NAMESPACE`
  namespace: "default",

  # Set the Kubernetes API group for this operator.
  # This can be overwritten using the @group attribute of a controller
  group: "your-operator.example.com",

  # Name must only consist of only lowercase letters and hyphens.
  # Defaults to hyphenated mix app name
  operator_name: "your-operator",

  # Name must only consist of only lowercase letters and hyphens.
  # Defaults to hyphenated mix app name
  service_account_name: "your-operator",

  # Labels to apply to the operator's resources.
  labels: %{
    "kewl": "true"
  },

  # Operator deployment resources. These are the defaults.
  resources: %{
    limits: %{cpu: "200m", memory: "200Mi"},
    requests: %{cpu: "200m", memory: "200Mi"}
  }
```

When configuring bonny to run _in your cluster_ the `mix bonny.gen.manifest` command will generate a service account for you. To use that service account configure the `k8s` library like the following:

```elixir
config :k8s,
  clusters: %{
    default: %{}
  }
```

This will add a cluster named `default`. When no configuration information is provided, the `k8s` library will use the service account of the pod.

## Bonny Generators

There are a number of generators to help create a kubernetes operator.

`mix help | grep bonny`

### Generating an operator controller

An operator can have multiple controllers. Each controller handles the lifecycle of a custom resource.

By default controllers are generated in the `V1` version scope.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.controller Widget widgets
```

You can specify the version flag to create a new version of a controller. Bonny will dispatch the controller for the given version. So old versions of resources can live alongside new versions.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.controller Widget widgets --version v2alpha1
```

_Note:_ The one restriction with versions is that they will be camelized into a module name.

Open up your controller and add functionality for your resource's lifecycles:

- Add
- Modify
- Delete
- Reconcile; periodically called with each every instance of a CRD's resources

Each controller can create multiple resources.

For example, a _todo app_ controller could deploy a `Deployment` and a `Service`.

Your operator can also have multiple controllers if you want to support multiple resources in your operator!

Check out the two test controllers:

- [Cog](./test/support/cog.ex)
- [Widget](./test/support/widget.ex)

### Generating a dockerfile

The following command will generate a dockerfile _for your operator_. This will need to be pushed to a docker repository that your kubernetes cluster can access.

Again, this Dockerfile is for your operator, not for the pods your operator may deploy.

You can skip this step when developing by running your operator _external_ to the cluster.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.dockerfile

export BONNY_IMAGE=YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_HERE
docker build -t ${BONNY_IMAGE} .
docker push ${BONNY_IMAGE}:latest
```

### Generating Kubernetes manifest for operator

This will generate the entire manifest for this operator including:

- CRD manifests
- RBAC
- Service Account
- Operator Deployment

The operator manifest generator requires the `image` flag to be passed if you plan to deploy the operator in your cluster. This is the docker image URL of your operators docker image created by `mix bonny.gen.docker` above.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.manifest --image ${BONNY_IMAGE}
```

You may _omit_ the `--image` flag if you want to generate a manifest _without the deployment_ so that you can develop locally running the operator outside of the cluster.

**Note:** YAML output is JSON formatted YAML. Sorry, elixirland isn't fond of YAML :D

By default the manifest will generate the service account and deployment in the "default" namespace.

_To set the namespace explicitly:_

```shell
mix bonny.gen.manifest --out - -n test
```

_Alternatively you can apply it directly to kubectl_:

```shell
mix bonny.gen.manifest --out - -n test | kubectl apply -f - -n test
```

## Telemetry

Bonny uses the `telemetry` and `notion` library to emit event metrics.

Events: `Bonny.Sys.Event.events()`

```elixir
[
  [:bonny, :scheduler, :binding, :failed],
  [:bonny, :scheduler, :binding, :succeeded],
  [:bonny, :scheduler, :nodes, :fetch, :failed],
  [:bonny, :scheduler, :nodes, :fetch, :succeeded],
  [:bonny, :scheduler, :pods, :fetch, :failed],
  [:bonny, :scheduler, :pods, :fetch, :succeeded],
  [:bonny, :reconciler, :genserver, :down],
  [:bonny, :reconciler, :reconcile, :failed],
  [:bonny, :reconciler, :reconcile, :succeeded],
  [:bonny, :reconciler, :run, :started],
  [:bonny, :reconciler, :fetch, :failed],
  [:bonny, :reconciler, :fetch, :succeeded],
  [:bonny, :reconciler, :initialized],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :genserver, :down],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :chunk, :received],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :watch, :timedout],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :watch, :failed],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :watch, :finished],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :watch, :succeeded],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :watch, :started],
  [:bonny, :watcher, :initialized]
]
```

## Terminology

_[Custom Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources)_:

> A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available on every Kubernetes cluster. In other words, it represents a customization of a particular Kubernetes installation.

_[CRD Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions)_:

> The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify. The Kubernetes API serves and handles the storage of your custom resource.

_[Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers)_:

> A custom controller is a controller that users can deploy and update on a running cluster, independently of the clusterâ€™s own lifecycle. Custom controllers can work with any kind of resource, but they are especially effective when combined with custom resources. The Operator pattern is one example of such a combination. It allows developers to encode domain knowledge for specific applications into an extension of the Kubernetes API.

_[Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)_:

A set of application specific controllers deployed on Kubernetes and managed via kubectl and the Kubernetes API.
