# Bonny

Kubernetes Operator SDK written in Elixir. 

Extend the Kubernetes API and implement CustomResourceDefinitions lifecycles in Elixir.

If Kubernetes CRDs and controllers are new to you, read up on the [terminology](#terminology).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `bonny` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bonny, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Add to `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :bonny, 
  # Add each CRD Controller module for this operator to load here
  controllers: [
    MyApp.Controllers.V1.WebServer,
    MyApp.Controllers.V1.Database,
    MyApp.Controllers.V1.Memcached
  ],
  
  # Set the Kubernetes API group for this operator.
  # This can be overwritten using the @group attribute of a controller
  group: "your-operator.your-domain.tld", 

  # Name must only consist of only lowercase letters and hyphens.
  # Defaults to "bonny"
  operator_name: "your-operator",

  # Name must only consist of only lowercase letters and hyphens.
  # Defaults to operator name
  service_account_name: "your-operator",

  # Labels to apply to the operator's resources.
  labels: %{
    "kewl": "true"
  }

  # Kubernetes YAML config, defaults to the service account of the pod
  kubeconf_file: "",
  
  # Defaults to "current-context" if a config file is provided, override user, cluster. or context here
  kubeconf_opts: []
```

## Bonny Generators

There are a number of generators to help create a kubernetes operator.

`mix help | grep bonny`

### Generating an operator controller

An operator can have multiple controllers. Each controller handles the lifecycle of a custom resource.

By default controllers are generated in the `V1` version scope.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.controller Widget widgets
```

You can specify the version flag to create a new version of a controller. Bonny will dispatch the controller for the given version. So old versions of resources can live alongside new versions.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.controller Widget widgets --version v2alpha1
```

*Note:* The one restriction with versions is that they will be camelized into a module name.

Open up your controller and add functionality for your resoures lifecycle:

* Add
* Modify
* Delete

Each controller can create multiple resources. 

For example, a *todo app* controller could deploy a `Deployment` and a `Service`.

Your operator can also have multiple controllers if you want to support multiple resources in your operator!

Check out the two test controllers:

* [Cog](./test/support/cog.ex)
* [Widget](./test/support/widget.ex)

### Generating a dockerfile

The following command will generate a dockerfile *for your operator*. This will need to be pushed to a docker repository that your kubernetes cluster can access.

Again, this Dockerfile is for your operator, not for the pods your operator may deploy.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.dockerfile

export BONNY_IMAGE=YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_HERE
docker build -t ${BONNY_IMAGE} .
docker push ${BONNY_IMAGE}:latest
```

### Generating Kubernetes manifest for operator

This will generate the entire manifest for this operator including:

* CRD manifests
* RBAC
* Service Account
* Operator Deployment

The operator manifest generator requires the `image` flag to be passed. This is the docker image URL of your operators docker image created by `mix bonny.gen.docker` above.

```shell
mix bonny.gen.manifest --image ${BONNY_IMAGE}
```

**Note:** YAML output is JSON formatted YAML. Sorry, elixirland isn't fond of YAML :D

By default the manifest will generate the service account and deployment in the "default" namespace.

*To set the namespace explicitly:*

```shell
mix bonny.gen.manifest --out - -n test
```

*Alternatively you can apply it directly to kubectl*:

```shell
mix bonny.gen.manifest --out - -n test | kubectl apply -f - -n test
```

### Generating a resource

TODO: Need to support validation / OpenAPI.

## Terminology

*[Custom Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources)*: 

> A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available on every Kubernetes cluster. In other words, it represents a customization of a particular Kubernetes installation.

*[CRD Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions)*: 

> The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify. The Kubernetes API serves and handles the storage of your custom resource.

*[Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers)*:

> A custom controller is a controller that users can deploy and update on a running cluster, independently of the clusterâ€™s own lifecycle. Custom controllers can work with any kind of resource, but they are especially effective when combined with custom resources. The Operator pattern is one example of such a combination. It allows developers to encode domain knowledge for specific applications into an extension of the Kubernetes API.

*Operator*:

A set of application specific controllers deployed on Kubernetes and managed via kubectl and the Kubernetes API.

## Docs

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/bonny](https://hexdocs.pm/bonny).


## Testing

```elixir
mix test
```

### Starting an interactive test session

This will load two modules in the operator, `Widget` and `Cog`.

**Create the CRDs:**

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./test/support/crd.yaml
```

**Start the session:**

```elixir
BONNY_CONFIG_FILE=~/.kube/config MIX_ENV=test iex -S mix
```

The GenServers wait about 5 seconds to start watching.

**Trigger some events:**

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./test/support/widget.yaml
```

If log level is set to `debug` you will see the events get sent to the pod's logs.
